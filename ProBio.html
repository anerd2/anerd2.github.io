          After graduation I plan to get into the fields of software development
          or computer graphics. I currently have not been a part of any
          internships. In an internships place I have a history of working
          full-time while attending Portland State University. Accompanied by
          graduating debt free, I will be able to move directly into the field
          of my choice. I desire to create quality content that someone can look
          at and say, "This is really cool." I do this all the time with games,
          shows, or music that I listen to. While I don't have skills that could
          help me be a game designer, an actor, or a musician. The skills that I
          do have help me work with computers and software. So, I will use those
          skills to push forwards the boundaries of what can be done with media.

          The most recent experience I have is from CS463 assignment 4. During
          this assignment I learned and practiced using Javascript.

        <p class="output">
          Before CS463 assignment 4 I worked on CS463 assignment 2. This
          assignment had me learn and practice using CSS to manipulate the HTML
          I wrote during CS463 assignment 1.
        </p>
        <p class="output">
          For CS463 assignment 1 I learned and practiced HTML. This was the base
          of the assignments that came after.

          The previous projects I have completed are compiled in the git
          repository below. While all the programs compiled show my progress
          throughout my education, CS163 program 3 and CS202 program 3 are the
          best showcases of my education.
