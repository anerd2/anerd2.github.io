        <p>
          After graduation I plan to get into the fields of software development
          or computer graphics. I currently have not been a part of any
          internships. In an internships place I have a history of working
          full-time while attending Portland State University. Accompanied by
          graduating debt free, I will be able to move directly into the field
          of my choice. I desire to create quality content that someone can look
          at and say, "This is really cool." I do this all the time with games,
          shows, or music that I listen to. While I don't have skills that could
          help me be a game designer, an actor, or a musician. The skills that I
          do have help me work with computers and software. So, I will use those
          skills to push forwards the boundaries of what can be done with media.
