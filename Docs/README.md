Final Project: Professional Website

Deployed at anerd2.github.io

I Used https://W3Schools.com to aid making the project.

This project is meant to be a website showing off what I have learned throughout my web development class.

There shouldn't need to be anything done to run the code. Just accessing the deployed site will show the code running.
