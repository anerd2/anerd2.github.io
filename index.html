          After graduation I plan to get into the fields of software development
          or computer graphics. I currently have not been a part of any
          internships. Instead of an internship I have a history of working
          full-time while attending Portland State University. Accompanied by
          graduating debt free, I will be able to move directly into the field
          of my choice. I desire to create quality content that someone can look
          at and say, "This is really cool." I do this all the time with games,
          shows, or music that I listen to. While I don't have skills that could
          help me be a game designer, an actor, or a musician. The skills that I
          do have help me work with computers and software. So, I will use those
          skills to push forwards the boundaries of what can be done with media.

          The most recent experience I have is from my web development class.
          This class is also refered to as CS463. During the 4th assignment in
          this class I learned and practiced using Javascript. Before CS463
          assignment 4 I worked on CS463 assignment 2. This assignment had me
          learn and practice using CSS to manipulate the HTML I wrote during
          CS463 assignment 1. For CS463 assignment 1 I learned and practiced
          HTML. This was the base of the assignments that came after. These
          assignments and the class overall has done a great job teaching me how
          to create, style and give functionality to website.

          The previous projects I have completed are compiled in the git
          repository below. While all the programs compiled show my progress
          throughout my education, CS163 program 2 and CS202 program 3 are the
          best showcases of my education. Since both of these programs were
          homework assignments they don't have names.
        </p>
        <p class="output">
          CS163 Program 2 was built to be the card game War. However it was also
          meant to train my ability to use the stack, data structures, and
          queues. It was written in C++ during my first year at Portland State
          University.
        </p>
        <p class="output">
          CS202 Program 3 was built to be a notebook application that can store,
          modify, remove, or display any website, news station, or zoom meetings
          the user wanted to. This application was meant to teach me about using
          more complex data structures and object oriented programming. It was
          written in C++ during my second year at Portland State University.
